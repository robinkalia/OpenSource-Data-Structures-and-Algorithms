The "Open Source - Data Structures and Algorithms" aims to provide a comprehensive set of algorithms in C++. 
This is a work in progress. In the first version "Version 1.0 - Beta", I aim to work on developing skeleton 
of the various algorithms that are asked in interviews and used by all big software companies and small software 
startups. Please do not use the code in "Version 1.0 - Beta" for doing serious stuff other than just skimming it
for personal knowledge since I mainly intend to write simple code for the most common algorithms used with 
different data structures. Also, I will keep on improving the quality of my code with a better use of STL. 

I will keep on building and improving my code over a certian period of time before just pushing on a decent 
quality code that could be used for small tasks. You have to write your own library to develop an efficiently 
scalable computing distributed platform. I don't claim that I am an awesome programmer, but I try to quickly 
prototype code that works and that could be maintained over time. When you face software engineering interviews, 
you should be able to quickly prototype these basic freshman Computer Science course based algorithms. I intend 
to cover the following topics in this software library.

1) Linked Lists
2) Stacks and Queues
3) Binary Trees
4) Multiway Trees
5) Graphs
6) Sorting
7) String Matching
8) General Algorithms

I will keep on adding to this list as I write more and more code with time. I will also keep on improving and 
optimizing my source code with a better use of STL and C++11 <algorithms> library. 
 
Thanks for going through my work. Your comments and suggestions will be helpful. Please send me an email at
